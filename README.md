# Automata League — Sumo

Two humanoid robots inside a raised circular ring. A robot wins by putting its
opponent out of the ring or down on the ground, by any physical means. Built on
MuJoCo, trained with TorchRL PPO and GPU-parallel MuJoCo-Warp using self-play.

The second environment in the Automata League, after
[automataleague-parkour](https://github.com/AutomataLeague/automataleague-parkour).

## Setup

```bash
uv sync                              # core: scene, task logic, CPU duels, rendering
uv sync --extra train --extra gpu    # training + MuJoCo-Warp (GPU box)
```

## Quick start

```python
from automataleague_sumo import make_env, list_environments

print([s.env_id for s in list_environments()])      # ['sumo-1']

env = make_env("sumo-1", robot="g1", level=0, backend="cpu")
obs_a, obs_b = env.reset(seed=0)
(obs_a, obs_b), (rew_a, rew_b), terminated, truncated, info = env.step(act_a, act_b)
```

Render preview stills of the arena:

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run python tools/render_scene.py
```

## The environment: `sumo-1`

A cylindrical dohyo of radius 1.5 m raised 0.3 m above the floor. Both robots
spawn diametrically opposite at 60% of the ring radius, facing each other, with
per-episode noise on position, heading and joint angles.

A side loses by leaving the ring radius, by dropping below the platform surface,
or by going down (base too low, or torso tilted past 50 degrees). A 15 second
timeout is a draw, as is a simultaneous loss.

Observations are `3 * n_joints + 23` wide, derived from the robot, and are
expressed entirely in the robot's own base frame. A rigid rotation of the whole
arena leaves them unchanged, which is what makes a single shared policy valid for
both sides in self-play.

### Curriculum

| Level | Opponent | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | passive, zero action | balance and hold the centre |
| 1 | passive, standing | push the dummy out of the ring |
| 2 | frozen level 1 snapshot | beat a real but static opponent |
| 3 | current policy on both sides | naive self-play |
| 4 | sampled checkpoint pool | league play |

The shaping terms of the reward decay across levels, from full weight at level 0
to 0.2 at level 4, so the final policy optimizes the actual win condition rather
than proxies like hugging the centre. Only the terminal win term is zero sum.

## Robots

Robots are pluggable through `RobotSpec`. Observation and action widths derive
from joint count, so adding a robot mostly means writing a new `RobotSpec`. The
CPU env currently assumes both sides share a robot (`sumo_cpu.py` reads
`scene.a.robot` for `action_scale`, `observation_dim` and `action_dim`), so a
second robot with a different action scale or joint count needs that handled
too before a cross-robot matchup works.

| Robot | Joints | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `g1` | 29 | Unitree G1, vendored from MuJoCo Menagerie |

We load `g1_mjx.xml`, the primitive-collider variant, not `g1.xml`. Two humanoids
in sustained contact make mesh colliders prohibitive under MuJoCo-Warp, and both
backends must share one model so CPU evaluation cannot disagree with GPU training.

## Training

The GPU backend steps `num_envs` parallel **duels**, each duel being one world
holding both robots. Under self-play the policy batch is twice that, because both
contestants are ordinary policy rows.

```bash
# validate and benchmark the backend before spending GPU hours
python tools/warp_smoke.py --num-envs 2048 --level 0

# one curriculum level
python examples/ppo_sumo.py level=0

# the whole schedule, warm-starting each level from the last
python examples/ppo_curriculum.py
```

`tools/warp_smoke.py` checks the four things that are expensive to discover late:
that the solver has not diverged, that contacts fit inside `nconmax` (MuJoCo-Warp
silently *drops* contacts past the cap rather than raising), that the two sides
are wired symmetrically, and what the throughput actually is.

## Tests

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run pytest              # CPU suite
MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run pytest -m gpu       # + CUDA and mujoco-warp (spark/jetson)
```

## Status

Phases A and B are complete: arena, task logic, CPU duel backend, registry.
Phase C is underway: the batched MuJoCo-Warp backend, PPO, and curriculum levels
0 and 1 are in. Still to come are the frozen-snapshot and pool opponents (levels
2 and 4), `tools/measure_reach.py` for the action-scale schedule, and Phase D's
Elo leaderboard.

## Licence

Vendored robot models under `assets/` retain their upstream licences.
